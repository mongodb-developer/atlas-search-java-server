# Atlas Search Server
A Java-based HTTP server `GET` interface for Atlas Search, supporting filtering,
sorting, highlighting, pagination, and debugging.

This Search Server code was initially written to support the article
["How to Build a Search Service in Java with MongoDB"](https://www.mongodb.com/developer/products/atlas/atlas-search-java-server/)
and video[TBD].

## Building and running locally

The `jettyRun` target is used and searches the `movies_index`. The search
server code lives under `server/`

To run the search server locally, follow these steps:

* Add the [sample collections](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas/sample-data/) to your Atlas cluster
    * If you're not already an Atlas user, [get started with Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas/getting-started/)
* [Create an Atlas Search index](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas/atlas-search/tutorial/create-index/) on the `movies` collection, named `movies_index`, using the index
  configuration below.
* Run the search service:
  `ATLAS_URI="<<insert your connection string here>>" ./gradlew jettyRun`
* Visit [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)
